# Sobrus Symfony API Test

This project is a Symfony-based RESTful API for managing blog articles. It includes various features such as CRUD operations, JWT authentication, file uploads, validation.

## Features

### Blog Article Management:

Create, Read, Update, and Soft Delete blog articles.
Blog articles include fields such as authorId, title, publicationDate, creationDate, content, keywords, status, slug, and coverPictureRef.
Uploaded images are stored in the public/uploaded_pictures directory.

### JWT Authentication:

Secure the API with JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
Login endpoints to authenticate users and protect certain routes.

### Validation:

Symfonyâ€™s validation component ensures data integrity, with constraints applied to article fields.

### Keyword Extraction:

A custom algorithm identifies the top 3 most frequently used words in the article content, excluding banned words, and automatically assigns them as keywords.

### Content Validation:

Banned words are dynamically loaded from a configuration file and validated against article content.

### Testing:

Unit and functional tests are written using PHPUnit to ensure robust API behavior.

### API Documentation:

Comprehensive API documentation using NelmioApiDocBundle (Swagger).
Easily visualize and test API endpoints through the documentation.
